# Web-Scraping-uisng-Selenium

Here I am trying to learn and implement Selenium Library in python for web scraping. 

Selenium is usually used for testing but it is also used for web scraping.

I have created a virtual environment before going to perfrom web scraping. It is generally a good practise to keep a virtual environment for the projects which are under development.
